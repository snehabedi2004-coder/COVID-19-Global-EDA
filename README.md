🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis (EDA)

📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the WHO COVID-19 global dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights in COVID-19 cases and deaths across countries and regions.
The goal is to understand which countries and regions were most affected, and to visualize global pandemic trends in an intuitive manner.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Analysis Performed
1.Country-wise Death Rate Analysis :-
 -Calculated death rate for each country
 -Identified top 10 countries with the highest death rate
2.Global Trends Over Time
 -Analyzed monthly new cases and deaths
 -Highlighted peaks in outbreaks globally and for India
3.WHO Region-wise Comparison
 -Compared impact across WHO regions
 -Visualized trends using bar charts and line graphs
4.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
 -Handled missing values
 -Standardized date formats and column names
 
🎯 Outcome
- Provides a clear picture of countries and regions most affected by COVID-19
- Offers insights into pandemic trends over time
- Serves as a base for predictive modeling or further analysis
  
💡 Future Scope
- Build predictive models for case forecasting
- Integrate vaccination data for impact analysis
- Extend to NLP-based social media sentiment analysis for COVID-19
